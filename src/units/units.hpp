/**
 * \class Unit
 * \brief Class that stores all the data of a Unit
 *
 * The Unit class encapsulates all the variables and containers that are related to
 * the definition of a unit. Those are:
 * - Unit factor
 * - Unit dimensions
 * - Unit name
 * - Nominator units
 * - Denominator units
 *
 * The unit factor is calculated based on the unit factor if it is stated and the
 * factors of the units that describe the units and are on the nominator or the
 * denominator of the unit. The calculation of the factor is done by the UnitTable
 * class, as it is needed to check the factors and dimensions of the units that
 * this unit is based upon and are stored into the UnitTable table that keeps all
 * the units parsed from a units file (nrnunits.lib by default) or the mod files.
 * The dimensions of the unit represent which basic units are used to define this
 * unit. They are represented by an array of ints of size MAX_DIMS. An array was
 * used, as the base units do not change based on the SI units. If a base unit is
 * used in this unit's definition then there is a 1 in the responding or else 0.
 * If a unit is on the nominator of the unit definition, then its factor is
 * multiplied by the unit's factor, while if it is on the denominator, its factor
 * is divided by the unit's factor. The dimensions of the nominator units are added
 * to the dimensions of the units and the dimensions of the denominator are
 * subtracted from the unit's dimensions. The Unit representation is designed based
 * on the units representation of the MOD2C parser.

 * - A table (hash map) that stores all the Units
 * - A hash map that stores all the Prefixes
 * - An array to store the base units names
 *
 * The names and the design is based on the corresponding ones of MOD2C.
 * The table is a hash map that uses as key the name of the Unit and as objects
 * a shared_ptr to a Unit. This is needed as the parser passes to the UnitTable
 * shared_ptrs, so that there is no need to allocate more space for the units or
 * take care of the deallocation of the memory, which is done automatically by
 * the smart pointer.
 * A shared_ptr to a UnitTable is kept by the UnitDriver, to be able to populate the
 * UnitTable by using multiple sources (files and strings).
 * The UnitTable takes care of inserting Units, Prefixes and base units to the table
 * calculating or the needed factors and dimensions.
