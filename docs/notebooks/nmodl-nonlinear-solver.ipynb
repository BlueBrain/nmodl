    "### [wip] NMODL NONLINEAR solver\n",
    "\n",
    "`NONLINEAR` blocks contain a set of non-linear simultaneous equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are solved at runtime using Newton iteration to find the root of a function $F(X)$ with Jacobian $J = \\frac{\\partial F(X)_i}{\\partial X_j}$, where $F$ and $J$ are constructed by the [solve_non_lin_system](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl/blob/master/nmodl/ode.py#L209) python routine which uses SymPy to analytically differentiate $F$ to find the Jacobian.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton solver is called `newton_solver` and is implemented in [src/solver/newton](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl/blob/master/src/solver/newton/newton.hpp#L33) using the Eigen matrix algebra library.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fall-back solution if the analytic Jacobian is not available is to use the `newton_numerical_diff_solver` variant of this solver that uses a finite difference approximation to estimate the Jacobian numerically"
