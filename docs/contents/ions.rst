Ions
====

NEURON supports computing the ion currents. For each segment there can be
separate current for separate ions, i.e. one for sodium ions and another for
calcium ions.

There are five variables associated with ions: the current (``ina``), the
concentration inside the segment (``nai``), the concentration outside the
segment (``nao``), the reversal potential (``ena``) and the derivative if the
current w.r.t. the voltage (``dinadv``). The names should be split as ``i{na}``
and therefore refer to the value for sodium, for calcium it would have been
``ica``.

These variables are physical properties of the segment. Therefore, there exists
one mechanism per ion. MOD files can include code to read or write these
variables.

NDMOL Keywords
--------------
A MOD file seeking to use ions should use ``USEION`` as follows:

.. code::

  NEURON {
     USEION na READ ina WRITE ena
  }

  ASSIGNED {
    ena (mV)
    ina (mA / cm2)
  }

Multiple ions are expressed by one line of ``USEION`` per ion.

The ``{ion_name}`` is a string giving the ion a name. For sodium it's ``na``
and for calcium ``ca``. If the no other mechanisms have defined an ion with
this name a new ion mechanism is created.

Both ``READ`` and ``WRITE`` are optional and are followed by a comma separated
list of ion variable names, e.g. ``ina, ena``.

Keyword: WRITE

Writing Ion Currents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In MOD file one can set the value of ion variables.

.. code::

  BREAKPOINT {
    ina = gna*(v - ena)
  }

Semantically, this states that the contribution of the Hodgkin-Huxley model to
the overall sodium current in that segment is ``gna*(v - ena)``. Since
everything is at the level of segment, we'll not keep repeating "for that
segment". Similarly, each mechanism computes a `local` contribution, i.e. the
contribution due to this mechanism to the actual `global` ion current.

Therefore, the following code for the following must be generated:

1. Compute the local contribution to the sodium current.
2. Increment the total, local, current contribution.
3. Increment the global sodium current by ``ina``.
4. Compute local derivative of ``ina`` w.r.t. the voltage.
5. Increment the global derivative of the sodium current w.r.t. the voltage.

The global current must also be updated as usual. However, this isn't ion
specific and hence omitted.


Storage
-------

Each mechanism that specifies ``USEION na`` contains a copy of all used ion
variables and pointers to the shared values in the ion mechanism, see Figure 1.

The pointer to the variable in the ion mechanism is prefixed with ``ion_``,
e.g. during initialization we might copy the shared value ``*ion_ena[i]`` to
``ena[i]`` (the copy local to the mechanism using the ion).

   Hodgkin-Huxley mechanism. This figure shows the NEURON memory layout.


Optimizing Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the common pattern is to only access the values of a particular instance,
the local copy isn't needed. I might facilitate SIMD, but it could be replaces
by local variables, see Figure 2.

This optimization is implemented in NMODL. It can be activated on the CLI via

.. code:: sh

   nmodl ... codegen --opt-ionvar-copy
